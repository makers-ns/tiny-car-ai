# tiny-car-ai 🧠🚗 
A playful introduction to computer vision and autonomous driving concepts using **SaraKIT**, a Raspberry Pi camera and AI — built for kids to explore how tiny cars can "see" and "think".

## Overview

This project demonstrates how a small car equipped with a camera (via **SaraKIT** on Raspberry Pi) can detect its surroundings and make simple decisions. 

It's designed as an educational demo for kids to learn the basics of:

- Computer vision 🖼️  
- Autonomous driving logic 🧠  
- Real-world sensors and robotics 🤖
